This bed and breakfast is run by a lovely couple, Adel and Christopher, who bring every guest breakfast baskets in the morning. Additionally, there is complimentary espresso and wine in the lobby, which has a comfortable feel. In the midst of everything, we happened to notice we locked our keys in the car when we had checked out and were on our way to a mud bath appointment at a local Spa. Adel, took it upon herself to not only drive us to the spa, but additionally picked us up from our appointment so we did not have to walk in the rain. OUTSTANDING SERVICE!!! The Christopher Inn goes above and beyond in their care for their patrons. Even waiting for the locksmith to arrive, we had the opportunity to get to know Adel and Christopher even better, and cannot wait to return.

The not so good reviews are real. We stayed in room #14 for one night. There were cobwebs in the corner of the room along with a nice size spider. The carpets are very stained and dirty as pointed out by other visitors. The room was very dusty. I had a very difficult time breathing in the room and felt as if I needed fresh air constantly. If you have any respiratory problems take the advisement \"stay away\". My husband and I were very disappointed given the cost for the one night stay. The jacuzzi tub was nice but somewhat small for what was advertised as a two person's tub. Also they have a large size 19 inch television that stuck out too much from the dresser making it difficult to move freely past the bed. For the amount charged there really needs to be a plasma television in the room. Also there was a small patio area for the room that appears to have never have had any work at manicuring it's appearance. An awful waste. Despite everything else I must mention the woman that greeted me at the front desk was very nice, knowledgeable and was helpful with interesting sites to visit and other tidbits. The only thing that concerned me was when I was trying to give her the key the next morning, she was talking to someone and kept talking for a while. She never acknowledged me even though she did see me and when another visitor came up she started talking to them ending her conversation with the 1st party. I had to say excuse me to get her to respond and all I wanted to do was give her the key. I read quite a few reviews before making my choice and in doing so I saw that the manager/owner made after thought comments after some parties reviews. Most comments made were that the visitor should have told them their concerns. Well it was not until I was lying in the bed that I could see the cobwebs and spider. Also would they have moved me if I said it was dusty and the carpet is too spotty?Would they have had a better room as there were concerns reported by others about other rooms with similar problems. I will never know. They have to know already that the carpets are spotty and the cleaning staff should be checking for cobwebs daily. To charge over 300.00 a night is a total ripoff. The breakfast with two crossaints and a dessert dish of yogurt with a small amount of fruit was very minimal for the price you pay to stay. The basket with these items was left at my door and I did not hear a knock to let me know it was there so I really don't know how long it was outside my door. They gave us cups for coffee and coffee in a Karafe but only 3 sugar packets for two people. Until they take their customers and repetation more serious, please be aware.

We love Napa and our favorites are Harvest Inn on the more economic side and Poetry Inn for special occasions. After visiting our favorite winery - Sherwin Family (you must visit if you haven't) we decided to go to Sunshine Markets for some cheese and crackers and find a hotel. We called El Bonita feeling adventurous and always hearing such great things about this place - they told us they had two rooms available - one king so we took it. We arrived and the young lady who spoke with us was horrified to realize she made a mistake - not looking at her handwritten books and there was no room. At this point we are hungry, I'm a little grumpy and deciding that spontaneity is overrated! The El Bonita recommended we try Christopher's Inn - I thought Calistoga was a little out of the way but off we went - WOW - what an amazing happy accident. This place is truly a gem. From the wonderful friendly service to the proprietor helping my husband find a special room (22B) it was just a dream. This place is a destresser if I've ever stayed in one - beautiful decor, the most comfortable bed I've slept in ourside of our own, we had wine and cheese on our private balcony surrounded by beautiful trees and looking down at the charming old world fountain beneath us, we walked to dinner at Jole, which was very delicious, and returned with our own key to the Inn as it was after 10 and it was just fantastic. The next morning, a basket of breakfast goodies, orange juice and coffee appeared at our door. Also a bath in the spectacularly spacious jacuzzi tub. Wow - a great experience - I hated to leave and will definitely go there again.

The muffins, assorted fruit, granola, juice and both decaf and regular coffee provided for all five of us was great. We stayed in Room A3 which had two queen beds in separate bedrooms. In addition there is a single bed in the living room area. All three beds had there own TV's (also perfect with teenagers).
