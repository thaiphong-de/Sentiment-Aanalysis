Check in was fine. Hallways smelled funny and were kind of dingy and dirty. Walking into room, it wasn't very clean and looked as though someone made the bed and wiped the bathroom down with a wet rag. Hair in the bedsheets, shower (many), and toilet. Some kind of film on toilet, looked like someone wiped off urine with their hand. Dust was thick throughout my room especially closet doors, and walls were grose. I did sleep well (on top of the covers with a sweater beneath me), but after all I was exhausted. The kicker- I was in Seattle to visit my grandma who is in the hospital with heart problems so I got in late. Housekeeping knocked on my door at 8am to ask if I was checking out when check out is at 12. at 11:30 I asked for a late check out and the frigid front desk clerk told me no because I wasn't an Elite Diamond Member for the rewards program, I also mentioned I work for a Choice Hotels property and she told me it didnt matter. I then proceeded to grab a pamphlet which EVERY brand of Choice Hotel's has and show her in writing that any level member of Choice Priveleges is entitled to a late checkout, and she told me that they should take it out of there because their property doesn't do it, \"Are you serious???\" (Keep in mind that 6000 properties have this same pamphlet and honor the program but hers should be exempt according to her). I walked back up to my room and I get a call offering the late check out after I walked away angrily. I get back up stars and at 12:15 and with a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in my door, housekeeping knocked again. I pulled the sign out of the door and asked housekeeping to read it. At this point I was so mad, I forgot about the 30 min nap I wanted to take before driving back home 3 hours, and they knock and call again 10 minutes later to see if I am out of the room. It was so rude and unreal I think I am still in shock.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna", "Title": "\u201cworse service ever\u201d", "Author": "TAMAR B", "ReviewID": "UR126602748", "Content": "I have never had such bad experience as my recent stay in Comfort Inn, Aurrora, Seattle.

The carpets are a little older and probably should be replaced soon. Rooms are quiet. Get an upper floor with downtown view - nice. The furniture is a little old, should get new tvs, But they include a dvd player with the tv, so bring your movies.

Breakfast was your typical continental breakfast & was constantly attended to by the staff of the hotel - always ensuring that coffee pots were full and breakfast items always stocked. On the plus side, in order to gain entrance to the hotel from parking garage & entering the hotel elevator to your room, access is only gained with the use of your hotel key - ensuring the guest's security.

The front desk staff was helpful with every request and question. The check in process was the fastest and smoothest I have ever experienced. She got thru the usual spiel and we had key in hand in and were headed to our room in under 2 mins yet she was polite and not hurried at all, just orgainzed and thourough. The lobby is clean, it has a microwave in it ( not needed as our room had one) as well as coffee tea and hot choc always availible free of charge. The room was a 2 queen with a pull-out couch, non-smoking room although a previous guest had decided not to follow the policy and there was a faint smokey smell. I think it was more noticable to us because US cigs smell way different than Canadian cigs, but we opened the window and in no time at all the smell had dissipated. I asked the front desk to insure the chambermaids left the window open the next day, and she made note of that, AND had them spray nutrilizer in there - it was not a problem after that! The Rooms were clean but housekeeping did not take the dirty coffee mug and plate from our breakfast back when they made up the room - not a big deal and the only thing that stuck out as being less than perfect the whole weekend The furniture was nice both in the room and in the lobby it looks like it was updated not that long ago. The bathroom was small but fine. But I found it odd that the bathroom door faced the beds - not what I am used to, most hotels I have been have had them at a right angle to the door of the room. Also the sinks are in the bathroom which meant if someone was 'going' others could not be brushing their teeth or whatever. With a big family I prefer the sink & vanity out of the bathroom but that was certianly not a deal breaker The Breakfast room is tiny as someone mentioned but the Huge selection of food more than made up for it -and REAL, MADE BY YOU waffles....YUM! The Breakfast staff was very on the ball and nothing ever ran out. The money one can save on the free breaky makes this a real plus. Definaly one of the best parts of the stay There is a ton of parking - including some covered parking and I felt safe leaving my van there at night. The drive to downtown is a good 10 mins BUT the route is simple and I actually felt safer being a bit farther out. Its in a commerial neighborhood, but it was a nice location. And because we planned to take advantage of the Fridge and Microwave in our room we were pleasantly suprised to find a grocery store 1/2 block away. There also seemed to be a nice selection of resturaunts nearby. Free Internet usage on the lobby computer, which is not something I usually worry about having in a hotel but a few times over the weekend I needed to look up something and it ended up being a great convienience.! No Pool, Small but suffiencient hot tub off the lobby. Room key card to activate the elevator was a pain in the butt, but I guess it's added security. All in all it's not 5 star but for the economy price range you get better than an economy hotel.... but ask for a top floor room so you dont have to hear the neighbors above you flush the toilet while you are trying to sleep!", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than Expected\u201d", "Author": "Rowse", "ReviewID": "UR20146701", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights on September 14, 2008.

Parking is free. The parking lot can be dark at night. The hotel is located on Aurora Ave and right next door to Sam's Club and some car dealerships are down the street.
