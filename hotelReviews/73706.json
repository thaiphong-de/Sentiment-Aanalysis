The location is good for that purpose but, to be honest, our hearts sank when we walked into the room. The web photos were deceiving. Admittedly, the room was clean and the bed comfortable, but the room was so dreary--and expensive considering what you get. Leave the bathroom fan on if you need 'white noise' to block out the planes (yes, the fan is that loud). We've stayed in many Best Western hotels before and this one is probably the most depressing. We had to drive miles to find a good restaurant for dinner.

Conveniently situated about 5 minutes from the Airport Terminal and also from the Car Hire Centre. The Hotel runs a shuttle every 15 minutes to the Airport which seems to work well. Situated close to the junctions of the I.17 to Flagstaff and the I.10 to Tucson in the south. The Motel is situated on two levels, but with no lift which could be a problem to some with luggage. The rooms are clean and ours contained two reasonably comfortable twin beds, room safe, TV and a small balcony. There was some noise overnight from the Airport and Interstates - this was not so bad as to create a problem, but clearly the sound insulation is not as good as it might be. The Motel has a small pool and whirlpool and provides some light refreshment in the morning, but not a breakfast - there is an adjoining Roadhouse Restaurant providing meals throughout the day which seemed quite good. The one disappointment which I had was that, after a long drive from Sedona, they would not let me check in at 2.30pm insisting that it had to be the stipulated 4pm. Can't really complain at that, but most hotels do allow early check in. Apart from that Reception Staff were friendly and helpful.

No elevator so be prepared to carry \"everything\" up the stairs. Not a big deal for me but beware for those not adept for that. We didn't use the pool but it seemed very nice and those that were looked to be enjoying it. The room was very comfortable. Everything was clean and overall the grounds were well kept. A minor bug is the hot water in the shower was not consistent. You had to be on the ready to adjust every minute as it would seem to fade away. Another minor annoyance is that we booked the room for 4 people and it was only stocked with 3 bath towels. I'm not in the hotel business but there has to be a way to match the room stock to the customer coming in. Anyway no big deal again to go to the front desk and ask for another towel. The noise level could be a bother to some. You are right next to the freeway and the airport and can clearly hear both in the evening quiet. We live near railroad tracks at home so we are accustomed to noise and weren't bothered by it but you could be if you are a light sleeper. The biggest downer was the front desk friendliness. There seemed to be a cloud of gloom hanging over a couple of the people working the desk while a couple others at least tried but seemed to be restrained by the gloom and doomers around them. At least crack a smile for the love of pete. The shuttle to the airport was nice and the driver was very courteous and friendly. He should be in charge of the front desk.

The property is old and not in a great part of town - there is nothing nearby worth noting (except the airport). Our room was clean and quiet. Front desk staff was efficient, but not particularly friendly. Not rude, just efficient. The airport shuttle is wonderful. We returned our rental car the evening before our flight and with just a phone call to the front desk, they picked us up and returned us to the hotel. The morning shuttle was prompt. This is not a place to stay for \"vacation.\" It's purely utilitarian, but served its purpose well. We opted to have a pizza delivered rather than eat in the attached restaurant. There was nothing within walking distance to go to, and it didn't appear to be an area in which you would want to go walking. It's a little pricey for the quality, but you're paying for the convenience of the airport proximity and shuttle. All of that said, I would definitely stay here again if my travel plans included a very early morning flight out of Sky Harbor Airport.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Japan", "Title": "\u201cNo internet...\u201d", "Author": "kevangogh", "ReviewID": "UR14421639", "Content": "I've stayed here several times.

Well, there was a wireless signal, but all attempts at logging in would hang. This was tried several times throughout the evening - all attempts at logging in at this place failed. No, I'm not a newbie - I have never had this problem anywhere else.
