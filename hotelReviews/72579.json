The best things about the place were the price and the location. You can walk to the space needle in 10 minutes, and even the downtown area is in walkable distance (a bit more than 20 min). The area is rather on the quiet side but there are restaurants etc. nearby. The included breakfast wasn't luxurious but you can choose from a wide range of foods (bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, fruits, you can even make waffles), a good way to start into a day of sight seeing! The room was alright, it was clean but a bit cramped with the two beds in there, but to get the better deal we had to book this room even though we only needed one bed. Little minus here: The heater was really loud, make sure you get the room warm enough before you want to sleep. The main complain I have is that when we complained about our very noisy neighbors at night the reception and security handled it very poorly, among other things they let the partying teenagers know that they would get three warnings before anything would be done about it. So we have to complain three times before we could get some qiuet in the middle of the night (it was after midnight by then)???? Another minus is that on hostelbookers.com, where we booked this place, it is advertised to have free parking but they actually charge 10$ (that made the good value a bit less valuable). On that page it wasn't really clear that it is a best western and not a hostel, either. Bottom line, this is a decent place but the staff don't exactly hang themselves to provide a good service.

We chose this hotel based on price and per my research, we thought the location would be fine. We did not have any issues with this hotel. It was decent for the price and the rooms were clean. The neighborhood was a little on the iffy side, but we walked to and from even at night with no issues. There were many cruisers staying at the hotel. I paid $107 internet rate for a king standard room. The room had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. Loved the soap/lotion/shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers in the bathroom and shower. I have the same in my baths at home. Wish every hotel would use those instead of the tiny bottles. I have to comment on the mattress. It was great. We have stayed at many hotels in which the mattress was too firm with no give, which hurts the bones, but these were very comfortable. The hotel offered an extensive free continental breakfast, which was decent. The breakfast room is way too small for all the guests, so we never found a place to sit, so we would gather our plates and take back to our room to eat. They also offer free internet services with 2 computers. No issues getting to use them. They also had a small gym area and a cute indoor whirlpool. For our after cruise stay for one night, they put us in a deluxe King room for $147. I would have preferred just the standard room instead of paying the higher price. The room was much bigger though and the bathroom had 2 sinks with a wide closet area. There was also a wet bar with the frig. From research, I do not agree that the location of this hotel is the best place to be for first time visitors that really want to enjoy everything Seattle has to offer. It was a 10 block (long) walk to Pike Place Market. We walked the first day to get lunch and to look around. My parents decided they would not be doing that again. For them, trying to figure out and use the bus system or metro was not to their interest, so we took turns paying for taxis to/from where we needed to be. At least that keep our individual costs down. Additionally, there are no restaurants or bars in close vicinity to this hotel. And, by close vicinity, I mean within a couple of blocks. So in the future, I would next time pay a little more and get a hotel closer to the Market area. There is a Walgreens about 4 blocks down and the Space Needle is about 6 blocks from the hotel. It was a $10 taxi ride to Pier 91. For others that have no real issue in those features, the hotel is great and I would recommend.

However, under the circumstances she did her best and remained friendly - even with all of the phone calls! The room was very clean. It was a 2 double bed room - but compared to the other two hotels that we stayed in during this trip the double beds seemd very small. We liked the effort to be environmentally conscious. Think that having the toiletry dispensers is a great idea. It was nice to have the fridge and micro. Room size I would say was on the smaller size - as there was no table (but there was a desk). Interesting toilet. There were only 2 sets of towels, so we had to ask at the front desk for 2 more bath towels, but they saw to it right away and I would say it was less than 15 minutes before they arrived at the room. A/C in the room worked well and was quiet enough to be kept on through the night. One of the things I hate the most is having to pay for parking. It is 10.00 here, plus tax. While I understand that lots of hotels are doing this now, it is a little annoying - especially when there are available parking spots. The breakfast was fair. Some interesting eggs - looked liked pancakes and you had to warm them up in the micro. Only one micro though and there was a wait for it.

The location to all of the popular attractions is perfect. The one thing you'll learn about Seattle is that you'll get used to walking! While you can easily get around town in a rental car, it's much easier to just use your legs! In regards to the hotel, it was very clean and includes your typical amenities, including shampoo, body wash, lotion and conditioner. This hotel uses a \"pump\" system to dispense the various items in the shower as well as at the sink, preventing a TON of waste with the little bottles! There is also a safe, refrigerator and microwave in the two different rooms that we stayed in (two double beds as well as a single double bed room). The front desk staff was helpful, even though there was a little mixup when we checked in. There had been a large group that had checked in earlier in the day that wanted to move their rooms around for whatever reason. The person that had been working during that period accidentally gave away our room (two double beds) and we ended up staying in a single bed room for the night. The staff person quickly offered a lower price on the smaller room and indicated we could switch to our correct room the following night. No harm, no foul on that! One thing to watch out here is the breakfast room, especially on the weekend. We went into the room around 9am and it was a NUT HOUSE. They do not have enough seating for the size hotel that it is, so plan on getting your food and taking it back to your room. The other guests I found to be very rude in the breakfast room, acting as if it was their last meal. But, I guess that can sometimes be expected when there are free items in the room! The pool/whirlpool/sauna are all open 24 hours, which was nice, since most hotels close their pools/spa area down around 10-11pm. Parking is $10/night, but free parking is VERY rare anywhere in the greater Seattle area. However, if you use Foursquare, you can check-in to the hotel location and unlock a free parking special!

It's rare to get a sauna in the US, so if I can find one, I go for it. The sauna - and hot tub - did not disappoint. They were clean and fully operational. Towels were on hand and the space was relaxed and quiet. Three of us were enjoying it that evening. I called ahead to make sure that the sauna was working and the answer surprised me.. that they indeed do have issues with it but that it seemed to be fine these days. So call ahead if this matters to you. The location of the hotel is excellent for proximity to downtown attractions as well as I-5 access. It's on a busy street, but I did not notice the traffic as I selected the quiet (alley) side. This hotel is very close to the start of the Seattle ride free zone, so free bus transport is readily available from this location, a money-saving perk. The Space Needle and Seattle Center are walkable. In fact, I had a nice view of the Space Needle from my room. The room was clean and attractively decorated. The beds were fine. The shower was fantastic. Water pressure the Sheratons and Hyatts I've stayed at recently cannot compare with. These are important features in a hotel room and they are all excellent for the price. Here's my little rant: One thing I notice in this hotel as well as most others nowadays is the abominable product that passes for in room coffee. Micro coffee maker with hyper plastic wrapped coffee inserts, and chemical \"cream\" and \"sugar\"... 90% plastic unwrapping, 10% coffee? I'd have to be an automaton to call this food. I am not buying the \"eco friendly\" room marketing on that note alone. Tea drinkers? Bring your own, and expect the coffee aftertaste from passing it through the same filter. In short, in room coffee has become a degenerate experience. To pass the eco friendly test, this whole concept has to be improved. Especially in Seattle where excellent coffee, high grade tea brands and eco-friendliness are a way of life. Luckily, this hotel includes breakfast and it is filling, with waffles, toast, cereal fruit, and yes, decent coffee and tea selection. The hours on breakfast service are generous.

There is a Whole Foods, Walgreens, Starbucks, a small park for kids and a variety of restaurants nearby.

It was incredibly loud and annoying - and I barely got any sleep that first night. 2) The jacuzzi (which was a major draw for me), was broken all weekend long. Come on Best Western. One of the reasons I choose you as a chain is that I trust your brand - but when something like this happens, I feel I would be better served somewhere else... anywhere else. It's a weekend and the jacuzzi/hot tub is \"out of order\"? 3) They were laying down carpet on the weekend also, so as soon as the fun-loving partiers checked out, the noise was ramped up even further. It's home renovation time, and I got to hear ALL of it. 4) More \"bad luck\", but the television was not working properly on the first day, but this eventually sorted itself out. 5) A quibble, but a quibble nonetheless.

The location for walking is good only for the Space Needle about 10 minutes away. For downtown and the Pier restaurants and shops you will need to drive - but we found the parking easy to find and the meters reasonable. Anthonys for one will validate your parking and at night has free valet, so we did not have a problem being away from downtown to stay. The staff was very friendly, the use of the internet free, and the free breakfast of waffles, cereal and rolls made it a good place to stay. The room was comfy, clean and the hot water plentiful. For what it is we would not hesitate to stay here again - but it is not for the person who plans on spending a lot of time in the room.

I hope other people have had great experiences as Seattle is so Great but that was not my experience. I booked a non smoking room because, Yes, us difficult Californians don't like the smell of smoke. My room reaked of smoke. Obviously, the people who stayed there before probably smoked in the room every day. The manager, although understanding, said \"We can't control that, and we have no other room to give you. (Which was true in August in Seattle.) The next day, the electric on one wall went out and I was left with no reading lights. I was informed that there was nothing they could do about this until Monday but on Sunday the lights did come back on. Yes, they did give me a small discount but that was not the point. When I go to a city a don't want to have conflict regarding my room. The kids at the front desk were very nice but they didn't know what to do. Anyway, not all Best Westerns are bad but it really depends on the individual owner. If you have the money stay at the Westins as they offer a very consistent level of room and service.
