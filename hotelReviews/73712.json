We needed four single rooms total. When first walking into the lobby we were told they could accommodate us. After a few minutes of deciding where to stay we went back in and were told they only had one single available. We negotiated and were able to get doubles for the price of a single. All of us got our room keys, and proceeded to get baggage out of the rental car. 3/4 of the keys didn't actually unlock any doors, and we were told it was due to being too close to electronics. The one key that did work had 115 written on it. We open the door to 115, there is luggage open on the beds and the shower is running. (Good thing we didn't catch a glance) Returned to office and told them of the situation and she said, \"Sorry, were doing training and you were supposed to get 215.\" The lock to another one of our rooms still wouldn't unlock. They switched that room to 219. Our manager was uncomfortable with having an adjoining room to another room where we didn't know someone. So we switched 215 to 220. After driving 13 hours to Peoria, we all were in need of rest. After waking we found the towels were dirty, there were cigarette burns in a non-smoking room, and upon close inspection there was blood splatter on the walls, carpet, and curtains. The security latch in 219 was also separating from the door. The drain and stopper were missing from the bathtub. The grout in the bathroom looks like it hasn't been scrubbed since the place was built. There was a coffee pot, but no coffee. I told the attendant in the office about our experience at checkout and she said, \"Well you should have came down first thing to let us know about the problem.\" I'm sorry but after driving for half a day I'm not going to inspect our room, go down to the office, and have them switch the room once again.. But I guess next time I know. Not that next time we will stay at the Super 8.
