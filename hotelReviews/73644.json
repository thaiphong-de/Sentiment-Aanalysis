The charges received were in excess of 310.00 total for two rooms. On the subject of rooms, the shower leaked all over the floor, room was dirty and staff were obvioulsy ready to take advantage of travelers. I have stayed in hotels all over the world. One that comes to mind is the Movenpick hotel in Dubai... Our rate there is 156.00 a night for a five star Swedish hotel that is immaculate and with ammenities that far outweigh this dump... I have tried several times to contact the front desk on this matter however, no one will pick up the phone... When I contacted the Best Western customer service, I was informed that this chain can add charges post to original agreement. That is the way Best Western says GFY... If you are active military, DoD or DoS, do not stay at this hotel. I believe it was foriegn owed due to its lack of upkeep and poor staff. As a side note, anytime you decide to stay at a hotel that clames three diamonds but is listed as two stars, beware. Also, if they have security in the parking lot for the cars -even if it is in a spectacular area of town, take note...

Each floor has an ice machine, and theres wifi aswell as a computer room with printer/fax which is free to use. We found it a little hard to get to as we dont drive, but we managed in the end. There is a bus stop down the street, im not sure how reliable the busses are but we managed to get one downtown and it only took a matter of minutes to get there. I only saw 1 cockroach and that was outside by the benches near the pool, it was 40 degrees celcius so what do you expect! Our room was in the main building and from the sounds of it the rooms there are nicer than the ones surrounding the pool.

Surprisingly convenient -- we had a rental car and we were less than ten minutes from downtown, museums, and good restaurants. There is adequate free internet service and a small work-out room and a pool. Breakfast offerings were limited, but there was juice, fruit, cereal. By carefully selecting a well located room, asking for an additional floor lamp for lighting, and some judicious use of folded paper behind headboards and in the window frame to stop annoying vibrating sounds, we had a quiet, clean room, even if the furniture was a little worn and the room size was small.

The carpets were badly waterstained and both rooms had a musty smell. The front desk clerk was not friendly at all. When I called down to ask her to turn off the message light that was blinking on the phone, she didn't even answer the phone so I had to walk down to the office. Breakfast was okay. Mostly bakery items and a little fruit. We paid the same price that we paid for the two rooms at a nearby Residence Inn a week earlier and had a two bedroom suite that was much superior.

I made a list of the good and bad for you to decide... Good: 1) Price 2) Location was good to where I need to be (Dallas Market Center/World Trade Center just down the road) Far enough off of the Interstate where you don't hear freeway noise. (Behind the Anatole and next to the Wyndham) 3) Nice touches in room (refridgerator, microwave, coffee pot, hair dryer, small sofa, table area) 4) Privately owned and managed 5) Definitely different that your standard motel for decorations (kind of artsy cute & quaint... Spanish Style Theme) 6) Nice (free) breakfast spread each morning off the lobby 7) Carpet appeared new. 8) The largest closet I had ever seen in a hotel room, the room was also a little larger too. Bad: 1) My room had roaches (I counted 5 in 2 days) 2) Musty, humid smell in room (made my allergies go into overdrive) 3) Minor annoyances like loud fan in bathroom came on with the light every time, only compact parking in the front, bathroom very tiny, A/C unit was so loud and couldn't quite get the temp. like I wanted (either too cold or too hot), bed wasn't too comfortable, no internet service available (or at least I couldn't find any anywhere). 4) Some of the rooms in the back were exterior entry... so I wouldn't feel too safe staying there. 5) FYI: They had a no pet policy and a $60/per day fine if they catch you. 6) Rooms are older and some fixtures are dated I can't comment on the pool because I never used or even looked for it. And as for food, I don't know... when I checked in the guy told me they don't have food in the hotel, but there was a room service notation in the brochure. But after seeing my first roach 2 minutes after I got into my room... I wouldn't be ordering it anyway. In my opinion, I wouldn't stay here again because of the roaches (I left the lights on) and allergy issues...
